# Copilot Instructions — @nestjs/core

> Generated from governance.md by crag. Regenerate: `crag compile --target copilot`

Modern, fast, powerful node.js web framework

**Stack:** node, express, typescript, fastify

## Runtimes

node

## Quality Gates

When you propose changes, the following checks must pass before commit:

- **lint**: `npm run lint`
- **lint**: `npx tsc --noEmit`
- **test**: `npm run test`
- **build**: `npm run build`
- **ci (inferred from workflow)**: `sudo npm install -g npm@^9`
- **ci (inferred from workflow)**: `npm run test:cov`
- **ci (inferred from workflow)**: `npm run coverage`
- **ci (inferred from workflow)**: `npm run lint:ci`
- **ci (inferred from workflow)**: `npm run test:integration`
- **ci (inferred from workflow)**: `npm run build:samples`
- **contributor docs (advisory — confirm before enforcing)**: `npm run format  # from CONTRIBUTING.md`

## Expectations for AI-Assisted Code

1. **Run gates before suggesting a commit.** If you cannot run them (no shell access), explicitly remind the human to run them.
2. **Respect classifications.** `MANDATORY` gates must pass. `OPTIONAL` gates should pass but may be overridden with a note. `ADVISORY` gates are informational only.
3. **Respect workspace paths.** When a gate is scoped to a subdirectory, run it from that directory.
4. **No hardcoded secrets.** - No hardcoded secrets — grep for sk_live, AKIA, password= before commit
5. Follow project commit conventions.
6. **Conservative changes.** Do not rewrite unrelated files. Do not add new dependencies without explaining why.

## Tool Context

This project uses **crag** (https://www.npmjs.com/package/@whitehatd/crag) as its AI-agent governance layer. The `governance.md` file is the authoritative source. If you have shell access, run `crag check` to verify the infrastructure and `crag diff` to detect drift.
