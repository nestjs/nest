Defined in: packages/core/nest-factory.ts:396

Use NestFactory to create an application instance.

### Specifying an entry module

Pass the required *root module* for the application via the module parameter.
By convention, it is usually called `ApplicationModule`.  Starting with this
module, Nest assembles the dependency graph and begins the process of
Dependency Injection and instantiates the classes needed to launch your
application.
