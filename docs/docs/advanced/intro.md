# Advanced NestJS Topics

Welcome to the **advanced section** where we explore the hidden depths of NestJS.

## What You'll Find Here

This section covers topics that separate good NestJS developers from great ones:

### üéØ Dependency Injection Mastery
Learn how NestJS's DI system works under the hood, including:
- Request, Transient, and Singleton scopes
- Circular dependency resolution strategies
- Dynamic module patterns
- Custom injection tokens
- ModuleRef and dynamic provider retrieval

### ‚ö° Performance Optimization
Techniques to make your NestJS applications blazingly fast:
- Compression and response streaming
- Advanced caching strategies
- Clustering for multi-core utilization
- Profiling and bottleneck identification
- Memory optimization patterns

### üåê Microservices Architecture
Build distributed systems with NestJS:
- Message patterns and event-driven architecture
- gRPC for high-performance communication
- Kafka for event streaming
- RabbitMQ for reliable messaging
- NATS for cloud-native systems

### üìä GraphQL Deep Dive
Master GraphQL with NestJS:
- Apollo Federation for microservices
- DataLoader for N+1 query prevention
- Real-time subscriptions
- Custom directives
- Query complexity analysis

### üé® Custom Decorators & Metadata
Create powerful abstractions:
- Parameter decorators for request handling
- Class decorators for cross-cutting concerns
- Method decorators for AOP patterns
- Reflection API mastery
- Decorator composition

### üîÑ Lifecycle Hooks
Control your application's lifecycle:
- Module initialization and bootstrapping
- Graceful shutdown handling
- Custom lifecycle events
- Memory cleanup strategies
- Pre-shutdown processing

### üß™ Testing Strategies
Build bulletproof applications:
- Unit testing with dependency injection
- Integration testing patterns
- E2E testing best practices
- Mocking strategies
- Test doubles and fakes
- Performance testing

## Philosophy

This documentation is built on three principles:

1. **Show the Source**: We reference actual NestJS source code to explain how things work
2. **Real-World Examples**: All examples are based on production patterns
3. **Why, Not Just How**: Understanding the reasoning behind patterns

## Prerequisites

To get the most from this section, you should be familiar with:
- TypeScript fundamentals
- Decorators and metadata
- Async programming (Promises, Observables)
- Basic NestJS concepts (modules, controllers, providers)

## How to Use This Section

Each topic is self-contained, so feel free to jump to what interests you. However, the **Dependency Injection Mastery** section is foundational and recommended reading first.
