# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature aims to systematically add comprehensive unit and end-to-end (e2e) tests to the NestJS repository's sample applications. Currently, most samples lack proper test coverage, which limits their educational value and makes it difficult for developers to understand testing best practices in NestJS applications. This initiative will enhance the samples by providing complete testing examples that demonstrate proper testing patterns for various NestJS features and integrations.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer learning NestJS, I want to see comprehensive unit tests in sample applications, so that I can understand how to properly test NestJS components like controllers, services, and modules.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sample application contains controllers THEN the sample SHALL include unit tests for all controller methods
2. WHEN a sample application contains services THEN the sample SHALL include unit tests for all service methods
3. WHEN a sample application contains custom decorators, guards, interceptors, or pipes THEN the sample SHALL include unit tests for these components
4. WHEN a sample application uses dependency injection THEN the unit tests SHALL demonstrate proper mocking of dependencies
5. IF a sample application uses database integrations THEN the unit tests SHALL use appropriate mocking strategies for database operations

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer learning NestJS, I want to see end-to-end tests in sample applications, so that I can understand how to test complete application workflows and API endpoints.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sample application exposes REST API endpoints THEN the sample SHALL include e2e tests for all endpoints
2. WHEN a sample application uses GraphQL THEN the sample SHALL include e2e tests for GraphQL queries and mutations
3. WHEN a sample application uses WebSocket gateways THEN the sample SHALL include e2e tests for WebSocket functionality
4. WHEN a sample application requires authentication THEN the e2e tests SHALL demonstrate testing authenticated and unauthenticated scenarios
5. IF a sample application uses external services THEN the e2e tests SHALL use appropriate mocking or test containers

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer contributing to or maintaining NestJS samples, I want consistent testing configurations across all samples, so that testing setup and execution is standardized and predictable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN any sample includes tests THEN the sample SHALL use Jest as the testing framework
2. WHEN any sample includes tests THEN the sample SHALL have consistent package.json test scripts (test, test:watch, test:cov, test:e2e)
3. WHEN any sample includes tests THEN the sample SHALL have proper Jest configuration for both unit and e2e tests
4. WHEN any sample includes tests THEN the sample SHALL include TypeScript support for test files
5. WHEN any sample includes tests THEN the sample SHALL have proper test file organization (unit tests co-located with source, e2e tests in separate directory)

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer learning NestJS, I want test examples that demonstrate testing best practices, so that I can write high-quality tests in my own applications.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL follow the AAA pattern (Arrange, Act, Assert)
2. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL have descriptive test names that clearly indicate what is being tested
3. WHEN unit tests are written THEN they SHALL test both success and error scenarios where applicable
4. WHEN e2e tests are written THEN they SHALL test complete user workflows rather than individual functions
5. WHEN tests use mocks THEN they SHALL demonstrate proper mock setup, verification, and cleanup

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer running sample applications, I want tests to execute reliably in different environments, so that I can verify the samples work correctly on my system.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL run successfully in CI/CD environments
2. WHEN tests require external dependencies THEN they SHALL either mock these dependencies or provide clear setup instructions
3. WHEN tests use databases THEN they SHALL use in-memory databases or test containers to avoid requiring external database setup
4. WHEN tests are executed THEN they SHALL clean up any resources or state changes after completion
5. IF tests require specific environment variables THEN they SHALL provide default test values or clear documentation

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a maintainer of the NestJS repository, I want test coverage reporting for samples, so that I can ensure comprehensive testing and identify gaps.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN tests are executed with coverage THEN they SHALL generate coverage reports in standard formats (lcov, json)
2. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN they SHALL exclude non-source files (node_modules, dist, etc.)
3. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN they SHALL include both unit and integration test coverage
4. WHEN samples have tests THEN they SHALL aim for reasonable coverage thresholds appropriate to their complexity
5. WHEN coverage reports are generated THEN they SHALL be easily accessible and readable

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer exploring different NestJS features, I want tests that demonstrate feature-specific testing patterns, so that I can understand how to test advanced NestJS functionality.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a sample demonstrates microservices THEN the tests SHALL show how to test microservice communication
2. WHEN a sample demonstrates GraphQL federation THEN the tests SHALL show how to test federated schemas
3. WHEN a sample demonstrates caching THEN the tests SHALL show how to test cache behavior
4. WHEN a sample demonstrates scheduling THEN the tests SHALL show how to test scheduled tasks
5. WHEN a sample demonstrates file uploads THEN the tests SHALL show how to test file handling operations
